          <p>
            Dos keeps every list and task stored securely on your device via
            Core Data. There is no account to manage or cloud sync to wait for,
            so you can keep working on flights or with no connection at all.

          <p>
            Hold the mic button to dictate tasks, keep optional details and due
            dates close at hand, and celebrate progress with haptics and
            confetti when a list hits 100%.

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Dos is designed to keep your personal information on your device.
            This policy describes how the app handles the data you create while
            managing tasks and lists.
          </p>

          <h3>Information we collect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Task &amp; list content.</strong> Titles, optional details,
              emojis, and due dates are saved locally in Core Data. They are
              never transmitted to Instabug or external services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Speech dictation.</strong> When you hold the microphone
              button, iOS speech recognition converts your voice into text. The
              transcription is processed by Apple in accordance with your system
              settings and returned only to the app for insertion into the task
              field. Dos does not store audio or transcripts beyond your saved
              tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>App diagnostics.</strong> Dos does not include analytics,
              crash reporting, or advertising SDKs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How your information is used</h3>
          <p>
            Task and list data is used solely to display, sort, and sync content
            inside the app experience—lists, task detail, calendar view, and the
            celebratory completion screen. There is no server-side processing or
            aggregation.
          </p>

          <h3>Data storage &amp; retention</h3>
          <p>
            All data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the
            app. Removing a list permanently removes its tasks. Deleting the app
            removes all associated data from your device.
          </p>

          <h3>Third parties</h3>
          <p>
            Dos does not share information with third parties. The only external
            service touched is Apple’s speech recognition framework, which
            follows Apple’s privacy commitments.
          </p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Because Dos relies on Apple’s hardened storage technologies, your
            content benefits from the same device-level encryption and biometric
            protections that secure the rest of iOS.
          </p>

          <h3>Your choices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Delete any list or task at any time using in-app controls to
              remove data immediately from local storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Disable speech recognition in iOS settings if you prefer not to
              use dictation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Dos is intended for individuals 13 years of age or older. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children.
          </p>

          <p class="footnote">
            We may update this policy as the app evolves. The “Effective” date
            above reflects the latest revision.
